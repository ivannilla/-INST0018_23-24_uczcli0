 <p>Hello!</p>

 <p>	My name is Ivan, and I've lived all over the place. Making my way to London by way of Seoul, Chicago, Caracas, NYC, San Juan... and a few others in between. <br>	I did my undergraduate degree in Literature and Anthropology, where I wrote a thesis grounded in queer and critical theory. In this, I argued for readings of queer potentiality within the post-colonial modernist space. <br> I am a fan of coffee, reading in parks, and slow walks around grocery stores. <p>
